          <li><span class="bold">1982</span> - Born in Beijing. Grown up as "a rebellious teen, lazy at school" who drew manga-influenced comics and wrote fan fiction. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">1997</span> - Sent to Brighton College, a private boarding school in the United Kingdom at the age of 15 by her parents. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">2000</span> - Moved to Los Angeles by herself, living in a Koreatown apartment, and attended Los Angeles High School. </li>
          
          <li><span class="bold">2005</span> - Graduated from Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, where she majored in <span class="float" id="f1">politics</span> and minored in film studies.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q1">“Four years was enough to turn her off of politics; after a post-college stint bartending and doing odd jobs, she found herself drawn more to people than to policy.”</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2009</span> - Joined the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television Graduate Film Program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. Made her first work, a short film The Atlas Mountains.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2010</span> - Released a second short film titled Daughters, about a 14-year-old girl Maple, living in rural <span class="float" id="f5">China</span>, who is forced into an arranged marriage and takes a dangerous path trying to break free. It won First Place Student Live Action Short at the Palm Springs International Short Fest and Special Jury Prize at the Cinequest Film Festival.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q5">“Yes I am not only a woman, I'm from China and a woman of color. I have a lot of strikes against me, but it works for me because I do not feel at home anywhere. That is a blessing and curse. I have always felt like an outsider, like a chameleon, adapting and adopting a new identity wherever I go, just so I can fit in – to create a sense of home.”</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2015</span> - Directed her first feature, <a class="film-link" href="/films/zhao/songs_my_brothers_taught_me/songs_my_brothers_taught_me.html" id="songs">Songs My Brothers Taught Me</a>. Shot as a contemporary <span class="float" id="f2">western drama</span> on location at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. It was nominated for Best First Feature at the 31st Independent Spirit Awards.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q2">“Growing up in Beijing, I always loved going to Mongolia. From the big city to the plains, that was my childhood. Spending a lot of time in New York in my mid-20s, I was feeling a bit lost. I always joke that historically, when you feel lost, you go west. And for me, going west is west of New York. It's just a part of America that I don't think I knew anything about. South Dakota, for example, is mostly a ranching state. The dirt on the ground hasn't been touched. It feels ancient and static. And my life has been so transient and fast-moving that it's just such a nice feeling when I'm there, almost like time stops.”</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2017</span> - Directed <a class="film-link" href="/films/zhao/the_rider/the_rider.html" id="rider">The Rider</a>. Spent months with real <span class="float" id="f4">cowboys</span>. It premiered at Cannes Film Festival as part of the Directors' Fortnight selection and won the Art Cinema Award.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q4">
            “You mean (working) with the wild cowboys? That was probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. The older cowboys are like real old school who have never listened to a word any one says. The boys are on the road with their dad learning how to herd cows, or working on the ranch. They have very little female voice in their head. I told them what to do for five weeks. <br><br>
            "In life most often I get no. I will be honest with you. I go home and cry and then I wake up the next morning and I say let's try again.It's also about knocking on the right door. Sometimes you can break your head banging in the street filled with men. You have to make some changes but the foundation is not going to move until that generation dies off. For me it's about, can I build an extension? Can I build something from the start?”  </div>
          <li><span class="bold">2018</span> - <a class="film-link" href="/films/zhao/the_rider/the_rider.html">The Rider</a> earned her nominations for Best Feature and Best Director at the 33rd Independent Spirit Awards. She also became the inaugural winner of the Bonnie Award, named after Bonnie Tiburzi, which recognizes a mid-career female director. Met Frances McDormand during Independent Spirit Awards. They hinted at their future project together, Nomadland, an adaptation from Jessica Bruder's Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century. In the same year, <span class="float" id="f3">Marvel Studios</span> hired her to direct <a class="film-link" href="/films/zhao/eternals/eternals.html" id="eternals">Eternals</a>.</li>

            “Well, I do think, this is so boring you are going to roll your eyes, but I think Marvel, I think this film is very—I think they took a big risk with this one... <br><br>
            “But this isn't necessarily a surprise project for me. When I grew up in China, I didn't really have a lot of access to film, The first creative storytelling I encountered was Japanese manga. I wanted to be a manga artist for the longest time. I didn't draw very well. But comic books and animation were always a passion of mine. It wasn't a huge part of the dialogue at film school. I was very curious to get into that.” </div>
          <li><span class="bold">2020</span> - <a class="film-link" href="/films/zhao/nomadland/nomadland.html" id="nomadland">Nomadland</a> revolved around characters that can be found in the film are real people that Bruder <span class="float" id="f6">encountered</span> when writing her book and Zhao included in her movie. The movie premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim and won the Golden Lion award.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q6">“One of the last things we filmed was Bob Wells' final conversation with Fern. The way he articulated this lifestyle, that there's no final goodbye, that I'll see you down the road, that really stuck with me... We all had to walk away and compose ourselves. It's speaking to: We're all connected... We'll all see each other again someday.”</div>
          
          <li><span class="bold">2021</span> - <a class="film-link" href="/films/zhao/nomadland/nomadland.html">Nomadland</a> was released. She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director for it.
