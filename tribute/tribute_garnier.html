          <li><span class="bold">1981</span> - Her father, Friedrich Ernst von Garnier, is a world-famous colour designer who gave Katja a <span class="float" id="f2">camera</span> for her 15th birthday. </li>
          <div class="quote" id="q2">"We then travelled to the Atlantic in France, and for two weeks I did nothing else but take pictures of water, waves and sands. Everybody was terribly cross with me because they were not on the photos. But they were really wonderful photos of waves. I was totally taken in, and at some time I also started developing the pictures myself."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">1985</span> - Studied history of art, German philology, Theory of Drama and Film at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University in Frankfurt.</li>
          
          <li><span class="bold">1989</span> - Directed her first short film "Day Trauma" (German: "Tagtrauma") and shortly afterwards she studied Directing Arts at the Munich Acedemy High School for Film and Television. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">1990</span> - Together with her Swedish fellow student Ewa Karlström, she established "VELA-X-Film Production", and in the course of the next few years they produce three joint movies. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">1992</span> - Start shooting the 55-minute <span class="float" id="f3">student</span> graduation film "Abgeschminkt" ("Making Up!").</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q3">"many women recognize themselves and in which men can learn a few things", as Katja von Garnier once said in an interview. "Making up!" was actually only meant as an "exercise film" for the high school for film arts. Preparations for this film lasted a whole year, however it took hardly a couple of weeks for the shooting and was partly made in producer Ewa Karlström's student's rooms. </div>
          <li><span class="bold">1994</span> - She was straightaway regarded as shooting star and "<span class="float" id="f4">saviour</span>" of the German film industry because of the big success of the short film. She receives the Ernst-Lubitsch Award, the Bavarian and the German Film Award and 21st Student Academy Awards. </li>
          <div class="quote" id="q4">"Making Up!" actually was a low budget film which cost a mere 80,000 DM (about 50,000 US dollars) and was for five months in the top 10 of the German film charts and a whole year in German cinemas, delighting a total of 1.2 millions of visitors in Germany. According to the German weekly magazine "Spiegel" - "the whole film industry at her beck and call". Katja von Garneir received numerous film offers from the U.S.A. which in Hollywood make her feel like "Alice in Wonderland" </div>
          <li><span class="bold">1995</span> - Signed a contract to direct the 20 million dollar U.S. production "Moonlight and Valentino". But the film studio became impatient for she wanted to change the unfinished script and casting. Though she had already invested six months in this film, she remained faithful to her principles and cancelled the contract due to "<span class="float" id="f5">artistic differences</span>".</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q5">
            "The shooting stipulations for 'Moonlight & Valentino' in making the film the way I wanted were simply impossible. So I didn't do it. After I had overcome the self-induced shock of this step I felt terribly relieved...<br><br>
            "I didn't want to stumble into something which I am not and which I am not willing to do at all. It's very seductive, because all of a sudden there is money or a country where one could make a film. But for the first great feature movie everything has to be right so that one can be true to the project. Many people held me as crazy because I said no. But the important question was whether this was really worth eighteen months of my life."</div>
          
          <li><span class="bold">1996</span> - Start screenplaying and directing first feature-length <span class="float" id="f6">music</span> film <a class="film-link" href="/films/garnier/bandits/bandits.html" id="bandits">Bandits</a>, told the story of four female prison inmates who form a band.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q6">
            "The film 'Hair' by Milos Forman has been my absolute number one movie since I was twelve and is still my favourite. Music films are something that have always fascinated me. Well, and music anyway. It helps one in getting over bad moods and makes sadness sometimes turn into an event. <br><br>
            "I wanted it to be a music film. But it's not only about visually extravagant music; the music is important as an outlet for pent-up emotions, for the dramatic creative key note of the movie, in whose center the developing friendship of the four women stands. When I wrote the script I occupied myself a lot with mythology in order to find out what really makes a heroe's story. The characters in our movie had to be greater than life - exactly cinema characters."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">1997</span> - The opinions to <a class="film-link" href="/films/garnier/bandits/bandits.html">Bandits</a> are extremely divided in Germany, and hardly a German feature movie over recent years was discussed as <span class="float" id="f7">controversially</span> and had to put up with so much indiscriminate criticism as this film. </li>
          <div class="quote" id="q7">Jasmin Tabatabai, "bandits" actress and composer:<br>
 
            "Meanwhile the film 'bandits' is considered as a 'women's lib film', but at the beginning we did not give much thought on this subject, that is until the reactions came: a terribly bad press and nothing else but abuses from within the film industry. They were so mean and spiteful that one felt: This has got nothing to do with the film, but with something completely different. <br>
            "'Bandits' was a film not meant to be against men, but just made for women. Women were the centre of interest, and women made the decisions. This was apparently a threat. But we didn't let anything on at that time. The only thing that saved us was the fact that we didn't attack each other and so. We passed through it. We had our arguments too and knocked each other about, so to speak - but outwardly we held together. This also gained the respect of those guys.  <br>
            "Today I would do it quite differently. Today I would go on the offensive and deliberately say: 'In fact, this is a women's film! Made by women and for women. And for cool men. You got a problem with that?'"</div>
          <li><span class="bold">1998</span> - The soundtrack CD of the film climbed straight to 3rd place in the German charts, and later even topped place 1 in Germany where it remained for several weeks and was actually awarded the "Golden Record". </li>
          <li><span class="bold">1999</span> - Showed as one of the jury members at the 49th Berlinale, the International Film Festival in Berlin.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2002</span> - For the debut album "Only Love" by "bandits"-actress Jasmin Tabatabai, Katja von Garnier wrote the lyrics and composed the music of one of the songs named "Absence makes the Heart beat" which is the fifth title in the album. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">2004</span> - Directed <a class="film-link" href="/films/garnier/iron_jawed_angels/iron_jawed_angels.html" id="iron">Iron Jawed Angels</a>, financed by the U.S. cable TV channel HBO. With Hilary Swank and Anjelica Houston, she made a movie about the women's suffrage movement in the United States, for which Houston won a Golden Globe. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">2007</span> - Directed <a class="film-link" href="/films/garnier/blood_and_chocolate/blood_and_chocolate.html" id="blood">Blood and Chocolate</a>, an international co-production between the United States, Germany, Romania, and the United Kingdom.
