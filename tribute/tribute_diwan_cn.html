        <ul id="tribute-content">
          <li><span class="bold">1980</span> - 出生于法国。父亲来自<span class="float" id="f1">黎巴嫩</span>，母亲的一半血统来自法国，另一半来自罗马尼亚。 </li>
          <div class="quote" id="q1">"With my father being Lebanese, we always had in mind questions regarding the war—what you have and what you can lose. My father lost his father when he was three months old, and my grandmother raised them working as a school principal. On my mother's side, my grandfather wanted to be an opera singer, but he lost a lung during the war."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2001</span> - Joined <span class="float" id="f2">Technikart</span>, a magazine. Meanwhile, she was also doing an internship at Com8, JoeyStarr's streetwear brand, writing a novel at lunch time.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q2">Her colleague in Technikart: <br>
            "When she joined Technikart some twenty years ago, Audrey introduced us to Mathis, a bar in the 8th arrondissement where people hid (and where she more or less knew everyone)...<br>
            "Audrey is always late, Audrey is just passing by because she has an appointment afterwards, and another one after… There has always been something energetic and oxymoronic about this young woman from the beautiful neighborhoods, known to be registered in the young socialist section of the 9th."
          </div>
          <li><span class="bold">2007</span> - Published her first <span class="float" id="f3">novel</span> <i>La Fabrication d'un mensonge (The Making of a Lie)</i>. It took her reader on a seemingly innocuous dive into the world of bridal shops to better drift on a story in the form of a feminine urban road-movie. When presenting her with a prize for the novel, the director Claude Chabrol told her: “This could be a movie.”</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q3">
            "I've always wanted to write, but I had no desire for a job. I have accumulated experiences with the sole intention of remaining free. The risk of trying things is to be disappointed by oneself. I was often wrong and there is a value in error, we don't say it enough...<br>
            "It was not doing too badly in terms of sales. But I felt like I wasn't mature enough, it was too early. I had fun writing, but I needed to experience other things."
          </div>
          <li><span class="bold">2008</span> - Still writing for the magazine, but also started her career as a screenwriter. Her first work is a TV-movie called <i>De feu et de glace (The fire and the ice)</i>.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2009</span> - Published her second novel <i>De l'autre côté de l'été (The Other Side of Summer)</i>, trying to revisit the pangs of the woman in her fifties who offers herself the services of an escort boy. </li>
          
          <li><span class="bold">2010</span> - During her vacations she was working as a scriptwriter for the Canal + series, <i>Mafiosa</i>. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">2013</span> - Published <i>How to be a Parisian</i> co-written with Anne Berest and Caroline de Maigret directly in the United States, a bestseller translated into 31 languages. But the <span class="float" id="f4">desire</span> for directing has taken over.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q4">
            "When I decided to direct, I felt it was a deep, visceral desire, and I felt like I was ready. Writing, making-offs on other directors' sets, co-responsibility for a magazine that taught me how to make a lot of skills work together... I didn't have a secret plan, but in retrospect I did. Impression is that, by chance, I did things well."
          </div>
          <li><span class="bold">2018</span> - First encountered the book <i>The Event</i>, an autobiographically informed novel by Annie Ernaux, right after she herself had an <span class="float" id="f7">abortion</span>.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q7">
            "Clandestine abortion is a difficult subject to finance. You have to explain it, say that it also talks about desire, feminine pleasure and the desire for freedom. And, even if I don't have proof of what I'm saying, my feeling is that there are people who are not necessarily for abortion. Or, in any case, who do not want to be told about it. There is a growing excitement in society on the subject: this story raises the questions that girls in Texas are asking themselves today. While regularly I heard: 'in France the law is passed. Why make a film now?' I would love to see the same question asked of directors who come up with World War II scripts."
          </div>
          <li><span class="bold">2019</span> - After co-writing several crime thrillers with Cédric Jimenez, she made the directorial <span class="float" id="f5">debut</span> with the romantic drama <a class="film-link" href="/films/diwan/losing_it/losing_it.html" id="losing">Losing It</a>.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q5">"“I felt ready because I had things to say for myself and I didn't want to share them with anybody else.” </div>
          <li><span class="bold">2021</span> - Her 2021 film <a class="film-link" href="/films/diwan/happening/happening.html" id="happening">Happening</a> was selected for the main competition at the 78th Venice International Film Festival, where it was subsequently awarded the <span class="float" id="f6">Golden Lion</span>, thus making her the sixth female director to ever win this award. </li>
