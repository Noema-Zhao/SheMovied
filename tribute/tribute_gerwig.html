        <ul id="tribute-content">
          <li><span class="bold">1983</span> - Born in Sacramento, California, grew up in the River Park neighborhood, and was raised a Unitarian Universalist.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1990s</span> - Obsessed in ballet, wanted to be a <span class="float" id="f1">ballet dancer</span>, until her mother intervened, enrolled her in a hip-hop class that had none of the fanaticism.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q1">"I was an intense child. When I loved an activity, I had trouble doing it halfway. It was scary with ballet -- I would have gone to class for four hours a day, seven days a week, if I could have. And it's kind of a cultish world. Relationships between ballet teachers and students aren't always totally normal, and my teacher -- she was British and had been to the Royal Ballet School -- gave everybody 'ballet names', which put my mum over the edge: 'She gave you another name?!' My ballet name was supposed to be Scarlett, and my mum was like, 'No, she can call you by your given name, this is a cult.'"</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2002</span> - Graduated from St. Francis High School, an all-girls Catholic school in Sacramento. Instead of goting to New York University for a degree in musical theatre, she went to Barnard, joined the debating team and thought for a while that she might be a lawyer.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2006</span> - Originally <span class="float" id="f2">intended</span> to become a playwright, but turned to acting when she was not admitted to playwriting MFA programs. Then she was cast in a minor role in Joe Swanberg's LOL, and appeared in Baghead by Jay and Mark Duplass.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q2">When she looks at Baumbach, who knew he wanted to be a director from the earliest age, she worries she doesn't have the same singularity of purpose. In these moments, she returns to various touchstones of reassurance. "I read an interview with Lorrie Moore in the Paris Review, and she said she didn't feel 'called' to write. She said you really have to give yourself permission to do it. I was like, 'Oh my God.' I printed it out."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2008</span> -  Co-write and co-direct <a class="film-link" href="/films/gerwig/nights_and_weekends/nights_and_weekends.html" id="nights">Nights and Weekends</a>, became known as a key figure in the rising mumblecore film movement.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2010</span> - Starred in Noah Baumbach's Greenberg but it didn't <span class="float" id="f3">change</span> her life like expected. </li>
          <div class="quote" id="q3">"I was really depressed. I cried a lot. It was a hard year. I was 25 and thinking, 'This is supposed to be the best time and I'm miserable.' Looking back, I wish I had taken that time and written more, but it felt like acting was happening for me, and I went back to acting classes. The blessing and curse of my life is that I think I thrive when I have a singular purpose and a calling. But actually I'm happiest when I'm doing lots of things. And I have to reconcile that."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2013</span> - Co-wrote <a class="film-link" href="/films/gerwig/frances_ha/frances_ha.html" id="frances">Frances Ha</a> was released after having toured the festival circuit. She also played the <span class="float" id="f6">title role</span>, and received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Her parents make an appearance in Frances Ha as her character's parents.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q6">"But it feels kind of disgusting, like baking a cake and eating it yourself. Like, I wrote it, and now I'm doing it! It felt very Orson Welles."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2014</span> - Made her stage debut as Becky in Penelope Skinner's The Village Bike at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York. Also, she was cast in the lead role in a spin-off of How I Met Your Mother titled How I Met Your Dad, but it was not picked up to series. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">2015</span> - Another co-wrote film <a class="film-link" href="/films/gerwig/mistress_america/mistress_america.html" id="mistress">Mistress America</a> was released in August to generally positive reviews. In the same year, after honing and refining down the 350 pages on her first solo script, she was meeting with her agents at UTA to put together a list of producers and financiers to show it to.</li>
          
          <li><span class="bold">2017</span> - Made her solo directorial debut with the coming-of-age comedy-drama film <a class="film-link" href="/films/gerwig/lady_bird/lady_bird.html" id="lady">Lady Bird</a>, which she also wrote. The film grossed over $78 million against its $10 million budget worldwide and chosen by Time magazine as one of the top ten films of 2017.</li>

          <li><span class="bold">2018</span> - At the 75th Golden Globe Awards, <a class="film-link" href="/films/gerwig/lady_bird/lady_bird.html" id="lady">Lady Bird</a> won Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Musical or Comedy for Saoirse Ronan. Then, the film once again soared high, snagging five <span class="float" id="f4">Oscar</span> nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress (Ronan), and Best Supporting Actress (Laurie Metcalf). </li>
          <div class="quote" id="q4">"I remember when Sofia Coppola was nominated and how much that meant to me. I remember when Kathryn Bigelow won and what that felt like, and I feel like those women are the reason I was able to do this... <br> When I think about it — and I think about women of all ages — I hope that they look at this and they think, 'I'm going to go make my movie.' I just keep feeling like I want more female storytellers and I want it quite selfishly because I want to see their stories. I want to watch their movies."</div>

          <li><span class="bold">2019</span> - Directed a new film adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel Little Women, whose script she had been previously hired to write. <a class="film-link" href="/films/gerwig/little_women/little_women.html" id="little">Little Women</a> received six Oscar <span class="float" id="f5">nominations</span>.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q5">The nominations included Best Picture, Best Actress for Ronan, Best Supporting Actress for Pugh, Best Adapted Screenplay for Gerwig, Best Original Score, and a win for Best Costume Design. It reflected Oscars controversy after no woman (including Gerwig) was nominated for Best Director, a snub that was publicly noted by Hillary Clinton and Saturday Night Live, amongst others.</div>
