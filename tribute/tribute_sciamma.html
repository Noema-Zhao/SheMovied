        <figcaption id="img-caption"> “My movie is always about a few days out of the world, where we can meet each lover, love each other.

        <h2 id="tl-title">Here's a time line of Sciamma's life:</h2>
        <ul id="tribute-content">
          <li><span class="bold">1978</span> - Born in Cergy-Pontoise, a suburb outside of Paris. Her grandmother was a fan of classic Hollywood: Fred Astaire, Cary Grant and James Stewart.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1990s</span> - Attended Utopia, an art house cinema theater in Cergy 3 times a week as a teenager.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2000</span> - Earned her master's degree in French Literature at Paris Nanterre University, then started her first job after college in the <span class="float" id="marketing1">marketing</span> department of an internet startup.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="marketing2">"In nine months we lived the whole life of a business. It was a business flight simulator. We're up, we're flying. Argh, we've crashed. After that I went to film school."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2002</span> - Attending La Fémis, the première French film school, wrote her first original script <a class="film-link" href="/films/sciamma/water_lilies/water_lilies.html" id="waterlilies">Water Lilies</a>, and promptly landed behind the camera, shooting the script she had written as her final-year project. It was her first time calling the shots. Her first time as the <span class="float" id="leader1">leader</span>.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="leader2">"Yeah, leader, it sounds so arrogant and patriarchal. But cinema has a very strong hierarchy. And as a director you have to answer all the questions. If someone lights a cigarette they show you 10 boxes of matches and you pick the one to be used. Basically that's the job. What kind of light switch do you want on the wall? What colour paint do you want on the wall? So yes, you're the leader. But what you are doing is answering 50 or 60 or 100 questions a day."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2007</span> - Her debut film, <a class="film-link" href="/films/sciamma/water_lilies/water_lilies.html">Water Lilies</a>, bottled with the confusion and longing of adolescence, tried to make every viewer see the world through the eyes of a teenage girl. It was selected for screening in the section Un certain regard at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. But the shock of the new blindsided some <span class="float" id="critics1">critics</span>. </li>
          <div class="quote" id="critics2">"After a first-time sex going bad, the boy comes back and tries to kiss her and she spits in his mouth. Now at the time, 2007, everyone in the audience went 'Ugh', because they were disgusted with her for doing that. Now it's different. Right before the pandemic, Adèle showed the film at a high school and she called me up after and said that the reaction had changed. Everyone was whooping and clapping. They thought she'd done the right thing."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">2008</span> - The film <a class="film-link" href="/films/sciamma/water_lilies/water_lilies.html">Water Lilies</a> secured three nominations for the 2008 César Awards: she was nominated for the César Award for Best Debut, and actresses Adèle Haenel and Louise Blachère were both nominated for the César Award for Most Promising Actress. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">2009</span> - Directed her first short film, Pauline, as part of a government anti-homophobia campaign called 'Five films against homophobia'.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2011</span> - Her 2011 film <a class="film-link" href="/films/sciamma/tomboy/tomboy.html" id="tomboy">Tomboy</a> was written and shot in a matter of months. She wrote the script in three weeks, completed casting in three weeks, and shot the film in 20 days. It premiered at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival in the Panorama section of the festival. The film was shown in French schools as part of an educational program.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2014</span> - Film <a class="film-link" href="/films/sciamma/girlhood/girlhood.html" id="girlhood">Girlhood</a> was selected to be screened as part of the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. It also played at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. In interviews, she said that Girlhood would be her last coming-of-age film and that she considered it, Water Lilies and Tomboy a trilogy. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">2015</span> - Started to serve as the co-president of the SRF (Society of Film Directors).</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2016</span> - Worked as a screenwriter for André Téchiné, whose work she admired as a youth, to co-write the screenplay for his 2016 film Being 17. </li>
          <li><span class="bold">2019</span> - Her fourth feature film, <a class="film-link" href="/films/sciamma/portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire/portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire.html" id="portrait">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a>, premiered In Competition at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Queer Palm and Best Screenplay. She sees it as a manifesto of the <span class="float" id="femalegaze1">female gaze</span>.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="femalegaze2">"That's why the male gaze is obsessed with representing lesbians, for instance. It's a way to control it. Our stories are powerful because they are dangerous. We are dangerous. So it's a very good strategy to despise us — to undermine us — because it's giving us less leverage for a very powerful political dynamic"</div>
        
          <li><span class="bold">2020</span> - She was a founding member of the French branch of the 5050 by 2020 movement, a group of French film industry professionals advocating for gender parity in film.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">2021</span> - Her fifth feature, <a class="film-link" href="/films/sciamma/petite_maman/petite_maman.html" id="petite_maman">Petite Maman</a>, premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in March. It also screened at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award. In the same year, she co-wrote the film <a class="film-link" href="/films/sciamma/paris_13th_district/paris_13th_district.html" id="paris13th">Paris, 13th District</a> alongside Jacques Audiard and Léa Mysius.</li>
