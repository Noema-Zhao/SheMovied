        <ul id="tribute-content">
          <li><span class="bold">1954</span> - Born in Wellington, New Zealand. Her mother is Edith Campion (née Beverley Georgette Hannah), an actress, writer, and heiress and an orphan.</li>
          <li><span class="bold">1975</span> -  Though grew up in the world of New Zealand theatre, she initially <span class="float" id="f4">rejected</span> the idea of a career in the dramatic arts and graduated instead with a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from Victoria University of Wellington.</li>
          
          <div class="quote" id="q4">"But I felt I had to distinguish myself from the family. You know? Besides, I thought acting quite frivolous. Now I'm grateful that I was raised in an atmosphere which had some sort of gaiety to it. But at the time, I thought that these people were . . . insincere."</div>
          <li><span class="bold">1975</span> -  Attempted to go to an art school in <span class="float" id="f6">Venice</span>, but all sorts of complicated issues turned up.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q6">
            "This boy I knew was arrested for cocaine trafficking. And I couldn't speak Italian very well. And I was going to the school, but I wasn't really enrolled because no one could work out who I was or what I was supposed to be doing there. And then it was winter, and they had the agua alta, the water that comes up over your gum boots. Then, of course, I was under suspicion, too, because I was a friend of his. He told me later that his mother had sent him some potato puree from Hungary and that it had been misinterpreted. But that sounds a little unlikely to me now, you know?"
          </div>
          <li><span class="bold">1976</span> - Finally enrolled in the Chelsea Art School in <span class="float" id="f5">London</span> and traveled throughout Europe.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q5">"I didn't like England... I had to put a big lid on myself. But I thought: 'You've just got to live with this. This is the rite of passage to being an adult -- misery'.<br><br>

            "I have a complicated theory for why I was so depressed -- that in the Southern Hemisphere you can use the weather to relate your moods with. If you did that in England, where it's continuously bleak, you'd just die.<br><br>
            
            "Also, there's a fury I have when I hear an English upper-class voice -- that voice that speaks really loudly about its 'dahhhhggs.' Grrrr!"</div>
          <li><span class="bold">1977</span> - Back to Australia, started as a graduate student in visual arts (painting) from the Sydney <span class="float" id="f1">College of the Arts</span> at the University of Sydney.</li>
          <div class="quote" id="q1">"The art school I went to had young tutors who were into minimalist and conceptual art. They made everybody rethink their thinking about everything, which sent some people into sort of schizophrenic binges. But it was a brilliantly exciting atmosphere. You could do anything -- installations, performance, whatever.<br><br>

          "First I was a bit at sea. Then, suddenly, for the first time in my life I really tried to do something. I'd never had a commitment to my ability; I knew there were people cleverer than me. What I was looking to do was to just learn enough so that I could in some way be supportive of somebody who really was gifted." 
          </div>
          <li><span class="bold">1980</span> - Started making short films out of <span class="float" id="f7">direct passion</span> since painting's limit dissatisfied her.<span class="float" id="f1"></li>
          <div class="quote" id="q7">
            
            "I decided to try and make my artwork directly about the things that I'd rush home to ruminate about. Things like confusions about sex and intimacy, for instance. I was painting at the time, crude sexual paintings, I suppose, with some feminist imagery as well.<br><br>
            
            "There was a lot of performance stuff going on, too, so I used to put on little plays about women and sex -- things like that. Pretty weird, really. Next, I decided that instead of being in a play I'd film it."
          </div>
